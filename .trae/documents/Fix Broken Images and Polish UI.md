I will address the "improving and correcting" request by fixing the broken images seen in your screenshot and polishing the UI.

**1. Fix Broken Images (Correction)**
The "The image is generating..." placeholders are caused by unstable external links. I will replace them with reliable, high-contrast placeholders that clearly illustrate the concepts:

* **Telephone Game Analogy**: Replace the broken link with a custom placeholder titled "Analogía: Teléfono Roto".

* **Waterfall vs Agile**: Replace the broken link with a custom placeholder titled "Riesgo: Cascada vs Agile".

* **File to edit**: `js/data/guide-content.js`

**2. UI/UX Improvements (Improvement)**

* **Enhance Card Visuals**: Improve the `.card-header-visual` CSS to ensure images fit perfectly and look professional.

* **Sidebar Polish**: Refine the "Progreso del Aprendiz" section to make it look more integrated and less "floating".

* **File to edit**: `css/main.css`

**3. Verification**

* I will verify the changes by ensuring the code uses standard, reliable URLs and the CSS syntax is correct.

* You can then refresh your browser (localhost:8000) to see the fixed images immediately.
