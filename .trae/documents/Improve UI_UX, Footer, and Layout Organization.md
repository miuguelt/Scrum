I will improve the presentation, fix the footer, and clean up the containers as requested.

### 1. Structure & Footer (index.html)
- **Add a Footer:** Insert a proper `<footer class="app-footer">` at the bottom of the `.main-content` area. This will contain copyright information, version, and credits, addressing the "fix footer" request.
- **Simplify Structure:** Review the main wrapper elements to ensure there is no unnecessary nesting that affects the layout.

### 2. Styling & Elegance (css/main.css)
- **Refine Glassmorphism:** Update `.glass-panel` to be more subtle (lighter border, softer shadow) to reduce visual clutter ("unnecessary containers" feeling).
- **Modern Typography:** Adjust font sizes and line heights for `h1`, `h2`, and body text to improve readability and elegance.
- **Navigation:** Polish the sidebar menu items (`.nav-item`) with smoother transitions and a more refined active state.
- **Footer Styling:** Add styles for the new footer to make it blend seamlessly with the design.
- **Visual Cleanup:** Reduce the visual "heaviness" of cards and sections by adjusting padding and margins.

### 3. Content Presentation (js/data/guide-content.js)
- **Simplify Containers:** Review the injected HTML content strings. Where possible, remove redundant wrapper `div`s (like nested cards) to make the content flow more naturally.
- **Enhance Headers:** Update section headers within the content to be more visually striking.

### 4. Ease of Use
- **Spacing:** Increase whitespace between major sections to improve focus and readability.
- **Scroll:** Ensure the main content area scrolls smoothly.
