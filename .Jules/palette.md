**Action:** Created this file to track future UX learnings.

## 2024-05-22 - Hidden Functionality (Ghost UI)
**Learning:** Discovered a `ToastSystem` module that was fully implemented in JavaScript but completely invisible due to missing CSS. The codebase had "ghost features" that ran but displayed nothing.
**Action:** When seeing UI modules imported in JS, explicitly verify their visual rendering early. Don't assume presence in DOM means visibility.
